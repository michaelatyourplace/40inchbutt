        <div class="container">
            <div>Tailored to your group means that the male performers and your group are strangers to each other so doing a choreographed routine is pretty much pointless.  No one knows how the bride to be or birthday girl will react to a adult male performer so you get what you put out basically. This means I communicate with all the girls in your group and figure out what and how much attention they want while keeping the whole room entertained. </div>
            <div class="mt-3"> I will be respectful to all the guest in the room and give NOs all the space the need and mesh with the Yes of the group as well.  Tailored to your group means I have the ability to work with what is presented to me in a professional and respectful way while keeping the energy + party flowing.</div>
